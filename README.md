# Welcome to Mixed Messages#

## Description##
This is a portfolio project prompted by Codecademy.
It allows a user to run the function `console.log(mixedMessages());` and receive a randomized message.

### Features###
I have included within the object element holding the randomized words a method to add new words for randomization.
```
.addNoun(noun);
.addAdj(adj);
.addVerb(verb);
```
I plan to add a method to find and remove words as well, and possibly change the templated sentence which prints.
    *I fear, however, that this will cause unplanned grammatical errors*

Thank you for touring my first of many portfolio projects. :)
